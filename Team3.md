Hello, my name is Jianle Xie, but you can call me John. I grew up and currently live in 
New York City. I'm a chemotherapy infusion pharmacist by day and student by night/weekend. I love learning new things 
and exploring new ideas. I love the idea of using data to drive healthcare outcomes or make new technologies to improve
the healthcare. Some of my interests includes Machine Learning and person finance. I don't have much tech-related 
experiences outside of this program, but I'm always up for a challenge and a desire to learn. 

I will leave off with one of my favorite quotes: 

*"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; 
but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."* - Michelangelo
