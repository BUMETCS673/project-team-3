We are embarking on a six-week project to create an Employee Management System using Java and Spring Boot, motivated by the need to showcase CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a practical setting.

Our software will help organizations efficiently manage employee roles. Staff and administration workers will use it to create, read, update, and delete roles. The Following includes basic underlying potential users, functionalities, and technology stack. Additional users, functionalities, and tool may be added as this project progresses within our time and ability constraints. 

**Potential Users:**

1. Staff Workers: To view roles and request updates.
2. Administration Workers: To create, update, and manage roles.

**Basic Functionality:**

Our system will focus on CRUD operations:
- **Create:** Add new roles.
- **Read:** View existing roles.
- **Update:** Modify role details.
- **Delete:** Remove unnecessary roles.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Java:** as the default language.
-**IntelliJ as the default IDE
- **Spring Boot:** To build a reliable and scalable application/framework

Our project aims to showcase CRUD operations while delivering a practical solution for role management.
